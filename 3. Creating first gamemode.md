# Creating first gamemode

This is the first tutorial in which you'll take a quick look at all the basic features that will help you write your own simple gamemode, based on this tutorial. We'll write a simple gamemode where we'll cover the main functions, and you'll learn the rest as you read the full tutorial

## Writing code

### Preparing

First, we import everything that will be necessary. 

```python
from pysamp import (
    on_gamemode_init,
    on_gamemode_exit,
    set_game_mode_text,
    show_player_markers,
    show_name_tags,
    set_name_tag_draw_distance,
    enable_stunt_bonus_for_all,
    disable_interior_enter_exits,
    set_weather,
    limit_global_chat_radius,
    add_player_class,
    send_client_message,
    get_tick_count,
    )
from pysamp.textdraw import TextDraw
from pysamp.dialog import Dialog
from pysamp.commands import cmd
from pysamp import callbacks
import random
```

Now you need to create a `python/player.py` file. In it we will change our `Player()` class.

```python
# python/player.py

from pysamp.player import Player as BasePlayer

class Player(BasePlayer):
    _registry = {}
    """
    Retrieve an instance from the registry, creating it if needed.
    """
    def __init__(self, playerid):
        super().__init__(playerid)
        self.city_selection = -1
        self.has_city_selected = False
        self.last_city_selection_tick = 0

    @classmethod
    def from_registry(cls, player):
        """
        This should be used to make sure that our callback takes an instance of the class from the dictionary
        """
        if isinstance(player, int):
            playerid = player

        if isinstance(player, BasePlayer):
            playerid = player.id

        player = cls._registry.get(playerid)

        if not player:
            cls._registry[playerid] = player = cls(playerid)

        return player

    @classmethod 
    def delete_registry(cls, player: BasePlayer):
        """
        Removes an instance from the registry
        """
        playerid = player.id
        del cls._registry[playerid]
```

Also create a `python/spawns.py` file to store the list of spawns.

```python
# python/spawns.py

police_spawns = [
[1568.2250,-1693.5483,5.8906,177.0983],

Create a `python/vars.py` file that stores city IDs.

```python
# python/vars.py

CITY_LOS_SANTOS = 0
CITY_SAN_FIERRO = 1
CITY_LAS_VENTURAS = 2
```

Now that we have created all the necessary files, let's go back to `__init__.py` and import the rest.

```python
from .spawns import *
from .vars import CITY_LOS_SANTOS, CITY_SAN_FIERRO, CITY_LAS_VENTURAS
from .player import Player
```

### Creating gamemode

Now that we're done with all the preparations. Let's start writing the gamemode itself. Let's start by setting up our mod. The code that is written in `@on_gamemode_init` is called as soon as you start the server, `@on_gamemode_exit` is called when you close the server. 

First, remove `Unknown` from the `Mode` tab. To do this, there is a function `set_game_mode_text()` which we imported earlier.

Note that `@on_gamemode_init` is an **event**, the function you write below is an **event handler**. Let's show this with the code we're about to write.

```python
@on_gamemode_init # event
def your_function_name(): # event handler
    set_game_mode_text("Tutorial") # code
```

Since we are writing DM mode, we should make it so that players can see each other on the game map, for this there is a function `show_player_markers()`.

```python
@on_gamemode_init
def your_function_name():
    ...
    show_player_markers(1)
```

It would also be nice to see the armor and health of other players, for this exist function `show_name_tags()`. You can also change the maximum distance of the display of names. To do this, there is the function `set_name_tag_draw_distance()`. The default value is **70**. However, I will set it to **40**.

```python
@on_gamemode_init
def your_function_name():
    ...
    show_name_tags(True)
    set_name_tag_draw_distance(40)
```

Also, you may want to disable stunt bonuses, for this there is a function `enable_stunt_bonus_for_all()`. A value of `False` will disable the bonuses, and `True` will bring them back. We also need to disable the standard entrances and exits of the buildings, for this we will use the function `disable_interior_enter_exits()`. 

```python
@on_gamemode_init
def your_function_name():
    ...
    enable_stunt_bonus_for_all(False)
    disable_interior_enter_exits()
```

Let's also change the weather, the `set_weather()` function will help do this.

```python
@on_gamemode_init
def your_function_name():
    ...
    set_weather()
```

Now we will work with the `add_player_class()` function. These game classes are the skins that you can choose after entering the game. You can configure their weapons, spawn position and more. But since we have created a separate file with spawns, you do not need to edit them. In this tutorial we will later create a command that gives weapons to the player. So you can skip a lot by writing `-1`. I will create some classes, they will all be the same, except for the skin.

```python
@on_gamemode_init
def your_function_name():
    ...
    add_player_class(1, 1759.0189, -1898.1260, 13.5622, 266.4503, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1)

```

As you can see they all appear without weapons and are prescribed the original coordinates.

We are temporarily done with `@on_gamemode_init`. Now let's start working with `@on_gamemode_exit`. We won't write anything there, so we'll just leave a ellipsis.

```python
@on_gamemode_exit
def your_exit_function():
    ...
```

Now let's start working with the `Player` events. The first event that is called is [`Player.on_connect`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/player.html#pysamp.player.Player.on_connect), it is called when a player joins the server. Let's use the [`game_text()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/player.html#pysamp.player.Player.game_text) function to send text to the player. Let's also greet the player using the [`send_client_message()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/player.html#pysamp.player.Player.send_client_message) function. We will also use `get_tick_count()`, which we will use later (when the player selects cities).

```python
@Player.on_connect
def on_player_connect(player: Player.from_registry): # we will use from_registry in every event handler
    player.game_text("~w~Grand Larceny", 3000, 4)
    player.send_client_message(COLOR_WHITE, "Welcome to Grand Larceny")
    player.last_city_selection_tick = get_tick_count()
```

That's all, now let's deal with [`Player.on_disconnect`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/player.html#pysamp.player.Player.on_disconnect). This event is called when a player disconnects from the server, we will use the function `delete_registry()` which will remove our player from the tuple.

```python
@Player.on_disconnect
def on_player_disconnect(player: Player.from_registry, reason: int):
    player.delete_registry(player)
```

Now let's start working with [`Player.on_spawn`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/player.html#pysamp.player.Player.on_spawn). This event is called every time a player is spawned. Let's also check if the player is an NPC. To do this, there is a function [`is_npc()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/player.html#pysamp.player.Player.is_npc). We will also put the interior to the player, in our case we will put the street to him, there is a function [`set_interior()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/player.html#pysamp.player.Player.set_interior) for that. We will also disable the player's clock, for that we use the function [`toggle_clock()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/player.html#pysamp.player.Player.toggle_clock). There is also a bug when a player is **accidentally given $300**. To fix this, use [`reset_money()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/player.html#pysamp.player.Player.reset_money). There is also a similar function [`give_money()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/player.html#pysamp.player.Player.give_money) to give out money.

```python
@Player.on_spawn
def on_player_spawn(player: Player.from_registry):
    player.set_interior(0)
    player.toggle_clock(False)
    player.reset_money()
    player.give_money(500)
```

Looks good, you can also give a skill to the weapon, for this we use the function [`set_skill_level()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/player.html#pysamp.player.Player.set_skill_level). Also on the documentation page you will find weapon IDs.

```python
@Player.on_spawn
def on_player_spawn(player: Player.from_registry):
    ...
    player.set_skill_level(0, 200)
    player.set_skill_level(1, 200)
    player.set_skill_level(2, 200)
    player.set_skill_level(3, 200)
    player.set_skill_level(4, 200)
    player.set_skill_level(5, 200)
    player.set_skill_level(6, 200)
    player.set_skill_level(7, 200)
    player.set_skill_level(8, 200)
    player.set_skill_level(9, 200)
    player.set_skill_level(10, 200)
```

Now let's start working with spawns, as you remember earlier we created several lists with spawns, this is where we will apply them. Let's start by importing our lists.

```python
from .vars import (
    los_santos_spawns, 
    san_fierro_spawns, 
    las_venturas_spawns
)
```

Now the code below may seem a bit complicated to you, but I will try to explain it as simply as possible.

You must create a variable `random_spawn` which will initially be `0`. After that, we will use the function [`randint()`](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/random.html#random.randint) from the `random` module that we imported at the beginning. After that we will set the player's position and use the function [`set_pos()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/player.html#pysamp.player.Player.set_pos). We will access each list using our `random_spawn` variable. Then we will access the same list but with `[0]`, `[1]`, `[2]`. It is also worth doing a check of the city (which city the player chose).

```python
@Player.on_spawn
def on_player_spawn(player: Player.from_registry):
    ...
    random_spawn = 0

    if player.city_selection == CITY_LOS_SANTOS:
        random_spawn = random.randint(0, len(los_santos_spawns))
        player.set_pos((
            los_santos_spawns[random_spawn][0], 
            los_santos_spawns[random_spawn][1], 
            los_santos_spawns[random_spawn][2]
        ))

    if player.city_selection == CITY_SAN_FIERRO:
        random_spawn = random.randint(0, len(san_fierro_spawns))
        player.set_pos(( 
            san_fierro_spawns[random_spawn][0], 
            san_fierro_spawns[random_spawn][1],
            san_fierro_spawns[random_spawn][2]
        ))

    if player.city_selection == CITY_LAS_VENTURAS:
        random_spawn = random.randint(0, len(las_venturas_spawns))
        player.set_pos((  
            las_venturas_spawns[random_spawn][0], 
            las_venturas_spawns[random_spawn][1], 
            las_venturas_spawns[random_spawn][2]
        ))
```

Now let's start working with [`Player.on_spawn`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/player.html#pysamp.player.Player.on_spawn). This event is called every time a player dies. For example, we will take money from the player when he died. We will also withdraw the player's money, for this there is a function. We have already encountered these functions. It's also worth checking for `INVALID_PLAYER_ID`. You can import `INVALID_PLAYER_ID` from module `samp` or you can do a check, since `INVALID_PLAYER_ID` = `65535`.


```python
from samp import INVALID_PLAYER_ID # not necessarily
```

```python
@Player.on_death
def on_player_death(player: Player.from_registry, killer: Player.from_registry, reason: int):
    if killer.id == 65535: # INVALID_PLAYER_ID
        return player.reset_money()

    killer.give_money(player.get_money())
    player.reset_money()
```

Now let's start working with [`Textdraw()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/textdraw.html) class. We'll explain them in detail later, but for now we'll just use some of their functions. You can also use the word `global` to create variables. But I will show you another, more convenient way: dictionaries. To do that, we go back to `python/vars.py` and add a couple of lines.

```python
# python/vars.py
...
textdraws = {}
```

That's all, now let's create a separate function that will initialize textdraws.

```python
def init_textdraws():
    ...
```

Now let's start creating text frames. The function [`create()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/textdraw.html#pysamp.textdraw.TextDraw.create) is used to create them. To start, let's just create 3 textdraws, which will be the names of cities. But before that, we import our `textdraws` dictionary.

```python
from .vars import textdraws
```

```python
def init_textdraws():
    textdraws[0] = TextDraw.create(10.0, 380.0, "Los Santos")
    textdraws[1] = TextDraw.create(10.0, 380.0, "San Fierro")
    textdraws[2] = TextDraw.create(10.0, 380.0, "Las Venturas")
    textdraws[3] = TextDraw.create(10.0, 415.0, "Press ~b~~k~~GO_LEFT~ ~w~or ~b~~k~~GO_RIGHT~ ~w~to switch cities~n~Press ~r~~k~~PED_FIREWEAPON~ ~w~to select.")
```

Now let's create a function that will customize our Texdraw, since all city Texdraws will be the same. First, let's hide the box, around the texdraw. To do this, use the function [`hide_box()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/textdraw.html#pysamp.textdraw.TextDraw.use_box). The value `False` will hide it. Also use the function [`letter_size()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/textdraw.html#pysamp.textdraw.TextDraw.letter_size) to change the length and width of the letters. Change the font using the function [`font()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/textdraw.html#pysamp.textdraw.TextDraw.font). You can find a list of fonts on the documentation site. You can also turn on/off the display of shadows using the function [`set_shadow()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/textdraw.html#pysamp.textdraw.TextDraw.set_shadow). I will also set the outline of the textdraw using the function [`set_outline()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/textdraw.html#pysamp.textdraw.TextDraw.set_outline). I will also set the white color for the textdraw using the function [`color()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/textdraw.html#pysamp.textdraw.TextDraw.color). I hope you didn't forget that we are creating a separate function, so it will take the argument `textdraw`.

```python
def init_city_textdraws(textdraw: TextDraw):
    textdraw.use_box(False)
    textdraw.letter_size(1.25, 3.0)
    textdraw.font(0)
    textdraw.set_shadow(0)
    textdraw.set_outline(1)
    textdraw.color(4008636159)
```

Now call this function in `init_textdraws()`. You also need to call `init_textdraws()` in `@on_gamemode_init`.

```python
def init_textdraws():
    ...
    init_city_textdraws(textdraws[0])
    init_city_textdraws(textdraws[1])
    init_city_textdraws(textdraws[2])
```

Let's also change the auxiliary (fourth) textdraw. We will use the same functions as in `init_city_textdraws()`, but we will also add functions [`text_size()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/textdraw.html#pysamp.textdraw.TextDraw.text_size) and [`box_color()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/textdraw.html#pysamp.textdraw.TextDraw.box_color). Also the background of the textdraws using the function [`box_color()`](https://pysamp.github.io/PySAMP/textdraw.html#pysamp.textdraw.TextDraw.box_color). Place the code below just below the function for creating the fourth textdraw.

```python
def init_textdraws():
    ...
    textdraws[3].use_box(True)
    textdraws[3].box_color(572662459)
    textdraws[3].letter_size(0.3, 1.0)
    textdraws[3].text_size(400.0, 40.0)
    textdraws[3].font(2)
    textdraws[3].set_shadow(0)
    textdraws[3].set_outline(1)
    textdraws[3].background_color(255)
    textdraws[3].color(4294967295)
```
